# DCAT-COG

two proposals are presented:

-Proposal 1 corresponds to the case where a single general dataset is described, with declinations appearing at the distribution level.

-Proposal 2 corresponds to the case where several datasets are described, the distributions presenting mainly information on the format.

All comments are welcome!
